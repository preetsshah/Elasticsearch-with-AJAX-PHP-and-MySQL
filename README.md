# Elasticsearch-with-PHP-and-MySQL
Make sure you have installed php and java in your computer.
First install php-composer at your working directory which will install all php dependencies for elasticsearch.
To just transfer of data from database to index, use db.conf.
For synchronization of data between database and index, use db_sync.conf.
Make sure your database is open in an application(i.e. MySQL Workbench) running on port no. defined, that is 3306.
